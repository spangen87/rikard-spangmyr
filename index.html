            <p>In the locking cylinder, two swivelling levers arranged on one side perform a double security scan over 
                the length of the key section and serve as an effective element against forceful picking.</p>

            <p>The cylinder is additionally equipped with a spring-loaded locking element in the case made of hardened
                 special steel. This locking element performs a contour-controlled security scan of the key.</p>
