## User Experience (UX)
### Wireframes
Wireframing was done before the project started. Some changes has been made on the way because it looked better on different screen sizes. And it is now following the same proportions through the site.

### Site Structure
The CES UDM page have one scrollable page with three sections: [Why CES?](https://spangen87.github.io/rikard-spangmyr/#why-ces), [About](https://spangen87.github.io/rikard-spangmyr/#about) and [Contact](https://spangen87.github.io/rikard-spangmyr/#about). Each section is linked in the header navigation meny. There is also one more page that confirms that you have filled out the form, [Contact Confirmation](https://spangen87.github.io/rikard-spangmyr/contact-confirmation.html).
The sections order is considered when deciding the visitors journey through the site. The Why CES should build an interest of the products, the About section should build some trust and finally the Contact section where the visitor can take the step to make contact if it's interesting to them.

### Design Choices
#### Typography
I choosed to use Roboto on the whole site. I wanted a clean look to the text and thought that Roboto was a good choice. To give the headings some additional styling I made them all uppercase and gave them some spacing between letters.

[Back to top](#contents)
#### Colors
Since CES already have a color on the logo, I used that in the color scheme of the site. Then I wanted to complement with some subtile colors and choosed a very light grey and also a dark grey color.

### Responsiveness Test
The responsive design for mobile devices is tested with [Googles Mobile Friendly Test](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly).
Manual testing is also made with [Google Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools). In DevTools I have checked that screens with width from 2560px down to 375px looks good and working properly.

### Validator Testing
The site is tested with [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) for the HTML and for the CSS with [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).
At first there were a couple of minor errors, mostly typos that were easy to fix. 

Here is the results:

![Image validating the HTML of Confiramtion page](assets/readme-images/html-validation-confirmation-page.jpg)

## Bugs
### Solved
- Found a bug that made ul in nav not completely in the center on smaller screens. I used dev tools to found that there was a padding to the left of the ul that made the distortion. Solved the problem by just adding padding 0 to the ul.
- When doing the validation i realized i had put the script for [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) below the body. The issued was fixed by moving it inside the body at the bottom instead.
- In the validating of the CSS file I found out that I had forgot to add size for the font at one place. The fix was simply to add the size in correct format.
